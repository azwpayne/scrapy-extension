  the spider keeps running and the operator can still diagnose via the log.
  Applied to every ``on_*`` hook (R5).

  The broad ``except Exception`` is deliberate (review feedback, R5): the
  decorated hook bodies are trivial -- the only callable that can raise is
  ``self._stats.inc_value`` / ``set_value`` (the rest is a string key), so a
  caught exception is in practice a StatsCollector failure, not a hidden
  programmer error. The wrapper also preserves the wrapped hook's return
  value on the success path (returns ``None`` only in the except branch), so
  future hooks that return meaningful values are not silently dropped.

  Directive: keep decorated hook bodies trivial (one stats call). If a hook
  grows non-trivial logic, move ONLY the ``self._stats.*`` call under the
  safe path -- don't let a buggy hook body hide behind this decorator.

  Stat keys (all additive — existing component stats are untouched):

  - ``queue/push_count`` (counter) — per successful push.
  - ``queue/pop_attempt_count`` (counter) — per pop ATTEMPT (R14-D rename of
    ``queue/pop_count``). ``BackendQueue.pop`` fires :meth:`on_pop` on every
    call — including empty pops — because the consumer-liveness signal is
    "is the worker popping at all?", independent of whether an item was
    returned. The stat name now matches the per-attempt behavior.
  - ``dupefilter/hit_count`` (counter) — per duplicate request.
  - ``dupefilter/miss_count`` (counter) — per newly-seen request.
  - ``queue/depth`` (gauge) — last-sampled pending depth.
  - ``pipeline/store_count`` (counter) — per successful store.
  - ``errors/<operation>`` (counter) — per operation error. Wired (R14-D) at
    the ``BackendQueue`` push-except and deserialize-fail arms.
  - ``queue/backpressure`` (gauge) — set to the sampled ``depth`` when it
    exceeds ``backpressure_threshold``; reset to ``0`` once depth drops back
    under. Set to an int on EVERY depth sample (``0`` under threshold) — it
    is ``None`` only before the first sample, never "until the threshold is
    crossed" (the gauge follows depth, not threshold-crossing history).
  - ``queue/pop_rate_1m`` (gauge) — rolling pops/sec over the trailing 60s
    window (U2 operability). Sampled on the same cadence as the pop-path
    depth probe; falling-edge to ~0 = stalled consumer.
  - ``dupefilter/filter_saturation`` (gauge, 0.0-1.0) — filter fill ratio
    (U2 operability). Rises through 0.9 before ``dupefilter/filter_full``
    ever fires; leading indicator for raising filter capacity. ``0.0`` when
    the filter is unbounded or reports no capacity. Emitted by cuckoo and
    bloom filters (via :meth:`BackendDupeFilter.request_seen`) and by a bounded
    memory filter when it first reaches its cap and during later evictions.
  - ``backend/connect_count`` (counter) — per successful backend connect
    (R14-D connection-lifecycle). Wired from ``ConnectionManager.connect``.
  - ``backend/disconnect_count`` (counter) — per backend disconnect
    (R14-D connection-lifecycle). Wired from ``ConnectionManager.close``.
  - ``backend/retry_count`` (counter) — per connection retry
    (R14-D connection-lifecycle). Wired from ``ConnectionManager.connect``.

  All hooks are ``@_stats_safe`` — a failing StatsCollector is swallowed +
  logged at debug, never propagated into the data path (R5).
